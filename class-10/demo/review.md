## Loops

* For-Loop --> Used when we know ahead of time how many times we want the loop to run

`for (initial value; condition (to be true); increment){code to execute}`

* While-Loop --> Used when you don't know how many times the loop will run

`while(condition evaluates to true){execute this code}`

## Functions

`function functionName(parameters){code to execute}`

## Logical Operators

```javascript
`&&` - Logical AND // left AND right must both evaluate to true to evaluate overall expression as true
`||` - Logical OR // if left OR right evaluate to true, overall expression evaluates to true
`!==` - Logical NOT // stands for "does not" or 
```

## Comparison/Assignment Operators

 `=` --> assignment

 `==` --> loosely equals

 `===` --> strictly equals (data type must match)

## DATA TYPES

number --> 42 (no quotes)

string --> 'surrounded with quotes' // text

boolean --> true/false

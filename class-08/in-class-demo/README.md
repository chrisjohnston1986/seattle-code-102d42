# Class 8 Notes

## FOR LOOP

* A for-loop repeats until a specificed condition evaluates to false
* A for-loop is generally used when we know the number of times we need it ahead of time

### Structure of a for-loop:

`for(initial value ; condition to evaluate (execute if true) ; increment){code to execute}`

```javascript
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++>){
  console.log(i);
}
```

---

## WHILE LOOP

* A while-loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false
* Used when we don't know how many times it's going to take

### Structure of a while loop:

`while(condition is true){execute this code}`

```javascript
let x = true

while (x){
  console.log('hi!');
  x = false;
}
```
